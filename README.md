# Overview

I made a voice memos app to learn a bit about how to make apps.

It is a voice memos app. You can record a memo and then play it back later if you want.

For fun, and to learn

# Development Environment

I used VS Code and the expo go app.

The languages and frameworks i used are javascript and React native.

# Useful Websites

- [W3 Schools React tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/react/default.asp)

# Future Work

- I would like to make it where you can add a title and description to every memo
- I would also like to make a scroll bar for when you play the memos.
- I would also like to improve how it looks.
